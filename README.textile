bert-clj is an implementation of "mojombo's bert":http://github.com/mojombo/bert/ in clojure. It is currently ready for use, but not tested in a real environment. Please try it out and file bug reports. I'm happy to fix anything that's wrong with it.

h2. Usage

There are two ways to use bert-clj. One, you can just add bert-clj/src/main/clojure to your classpath. If you take that route, you can then do the following:

<pre>
>  (require '[com.trottercashion.bert-clj.bert :as bert])
>  (bert/encode 72)            ;; => (-125 97 72)
>  (bert/decode '(-125 97 72)) ;; => 72
</pre>

Alternately, you can use maven to assemble a jar that can then be added to your classpath. On the command line, do the following:

<pre>
$ mvn assembly:assembly
$ java -cp target/bert-clj-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar clojure.lang.Repl
>  (require '[com.trottercashion.bert-clj.bert :as bert])
>  (bert/encode 72)            ;; => (-125 97 72)
>  (bert/decode '(-125 97 72)) ;; => 72
</pre>

h2. Known Issues

bert/decode will currently only decode one bert at a time. If you'd like to add stream support, please do so and send me a pull request. Otherwise, I may get to stream support sometime in the next month or two.
