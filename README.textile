bert-clj is an implementation of "mojombo's bert":http://github.com/mojombo/bert/ in clojure. It is currently ready for use, but not tested in a real environment. Please try it out and file bug reports. I'm happy to fix anything that's wrong with it.

h2. Usage

There are two ways to use bert-clj. One, you can just add bert-clj/src/main/clojure to your classpath. If you take that route, you can then do the following:

<pre>
  (require '[com.trottercashion.bert-clj.bert :as bert])

  (bert/encode 72)            // => (-125 97 72)
  (bert/decode '(-125 97 72)) // => 72
</pre>

Alternately, you can go the route that doesn't appear to work right now, Maven. Basically, I'm a java idiot, but I've got a Maven pom file that _should_ allow you to build a jar complete with all dependencies using the assembly:assembly command. However, it seems to be building a jar that doesn't let you require bert. If anyone knows how to fix this, I'd love your help. Otherwise I'll fix it sometime in the future and remove this message :-)
